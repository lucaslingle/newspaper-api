I was involved in the events that reporter Shane Harris described, and I was an unnamed source for the initial story. What\u2019s more, I was named in, and provided the documents to Harris that formed the basis of, this evening\u2019s follow-up story, which reported that \u201cA longtime Republican activist who led an operation hoping to obtain Hillary Clinton emails from hackers listed senior members of the Trump campaign, including some who now serve as top aides in the White House, in a recruitment document for his effort\u201d:\n\nOfficials identified in the document include Steve Bannon, now chief strategist for President Donald Trump; Kellyanne Conway, former campaign manager and now White House counselor; Sam Clovis, a policy adviser to the Trump campaign and now a senior adviser at the Agriculture Department; and retired Lt. Gen. Mike Flynn, who was a campaign adviser and briefly was national security adviser in the Trump administration.\n\nI\u2019m writing this piece in the spirit of Benjamin Wittes\u2019s account of his interactions with James Comey immediately following the New York Times story for which he acted as a source. The goal is to provide a fuller accounting of experiences which were thoroughly bizarre and which I did not fully understand until I read the Journal\u2019s account of the episode yesterday. Indeed, I still do not fully understand the events I am going to describe, both what they reflected then or what they mean in retrospect. But I can lay out what happened, facts from which readers and investigators can draw their own conclusions.\n\nFor the purpose of what follows, I will assume readers are already familiar with the Wall Street Journal\u2019s reporting on this matter.\n\nMy role in these events began last spring, when I spent a great deal of time studying the series of Freedom of Information disclosures by the State Department of Hillary Clinton\u2019s emails, and posting the parts I found most interesting\u2014especially those relevant to computer security\u2014on my public Twitter account. I was doing this not because I am some particular foe of Clinton\u2019s\u2014I\u2019m not\u2014but because like everyone else, I assumed she was likely to become the next President of the United States, and I believed her emails might provide some insight into key cybersecurity and national security issues once she was elected in November.\n\nA while later, on June 14, the Washington Post reported on a hack of the DNC ostensibly by Russian intelligence. When material from this hack began appearing online, courtesy of the \u201cGuccifer 2\u201d online persona, I turned my attention to looking at these stolen documents. This time, my purpose was to try and understand who broke into the DNC, and why.\n\nA few weeks later, right around the time the DNC emails were dumped by Wikileaks\u2014and curiously, around the same time Trump called for the Russians to get Hillary Clinton\u2019s missing emails\u2014I was contacted out the blue by a man named Peter Smith, who had seen my work going through these emails. Smith implied that he was a well-connected Republican political operative.\n\nInitially, I assumed the query must have been about my work on the DNC hack; after all, few people followed my account prior to the DNC breach, whereas my analysis of the break-in at the DNC had received considerably more coverage. I assumed his query about the \u201cClinton emails\u201d was therefore a mistake and that he meant instead to talk to me about the emails stolen from the DNC. So I agreed to talk to him, thinking that, whatever my views on then-candidate Trump, if a national campaign wanted an independent non-partisan view on the facts surrounding the case, I should provide it to the best of my ability.\n\nYet Smith had not contacted me about the DNC hack, but rather about his conviction that Clinton\u2019s private email server had been hacked\u2014in his view almost certainly both by the Russian government and likely by multiple other hackers too\u2014and his desire to ensure that the fruits of those hacks were exposed prior to the election. Over the course of a long phone call, he mentioned that he had been contacted by someone on the \u201cDark Web\u201d who claimed to have a copy of emails from Secretary Clinton\u2019s private server, and this was why he had contacted me; he wanted me to help validate whether or not the emails were genuine.\n\nUnder other circumstances, I would have gone no further. After all, this was occurring in the final stretch of a U.S. presidential election, and I did not feel comfortable, and had no interest in, providing material help to either of the campaigns beyond merely answering questions on my already public analysis of Clinton\u2019s emails, or of the DNC hack. (I\u2019m not a U.S. citizen or resident, after all.) In any case, my suspicion then and now was that Hillary Clinton\u2019s email server was likely never breached by Russia, and moreover that if Russia had a copy of Clinton\u2019s emails, they would not waste them in the run-up to an election she was likely to win. I thus thought Smith\u2019s search for her emails was in vain.\n\nBut following the DNC hack and watching the Russian influence campaign surrounding it unfold in near real-time, Smith\u2019s comment about having been contacted by someone from the \u201cDark Web\u201d claiming to have Clinton\u2019s personal emails struck me as critically important. I wanted to find out whether this person was merely some fraudster wanting to take Smith for a ride or something more sinister: that is, whether Smith had been contacted by a Russian intelligence front with intent to use Smith as part of their scheme by laundering real or forged documents.\n\nI never found out who Smith\u2019s contact on the \u201cDark Web\u201d was. It was never clear to me whether this person was merely someone trying to dupe Smith out of his money, or a Russian front, and it was never clear to me how they represented their own credentials to Smith.\n\nOver the course of our conversations, one thing struck me as particularly disturbing. Smith and I talked several times about the DNC hack, and I expressed my view that the hack had likely been orchestrated by Russia and that the Kremlin was using the stolen documents as part of an influence campaign against the United States. I explained that if someone had contacted him via the \u201cDark Web\u201d with Clinton\u2019s personal emails, he should take very seriously the possibility that this may have been part of a wider Russian campaign against the United States. And I said he need not take my word for it, pointing to a number of occasions where US officials had made it clear that this was the view of the U.S. intelligence community as well.\n\nSmith, however, didn\u2019t seem to care. From his perspective it didn\u2019t matter who had taken the emails, or their motives for doing so. He never expressed to me any discomfort with the possibility that the emails he was seeking were potentially from a Russian front, a likelihood he was happy to acknowledge. If they were genuine, they would hurt Clinton\u2019s chances, and therefore help Trump.\n\nWhen he first contacted me, I did not know who Smith was, but his legitimate connections within the Republican party were apparent. My motive for initially speaking to him was that I wondered if the campaign was trying to urgently establish whether the claims that Russia had hacked the DNC was merely \u201cspin\u201d from the Clinton campaign, or instead something they would need to address before Trump went too far down the road of denying it. My guess was that maybe they wanted to contact someone who could provide them with impartial advice to understand whether the claims were real or just rhetoric.\n\nAlthough it wasn\u2019t initially clear to me how independent Smith\u2019s operation was from Flynn or the Trump campaign, it was immediately apparent that Smith was both well connected within the top echelons of the campaign and he seemed to know both Lt. Gen. Flynn and his son well. Smith routinely talked about the goings on at the top of the Trump team, offering deep insights into the bizarre world at the top of the Trump campaign. Smith told of Flynn\u2019s deep dislike of DNI Clapper, whom Flynn blamed for his dismissal by President Obama. Smith told of Flynn\u2019s moves to position himself to become CIA Director under Trump, but also that Flynn had been persuaded that the Senate confirmation process would be prohibitively difficult. He would instead therefore become National Security Advisor should Trump win the election, Smith said. He also told of a deep sense of angst even among Trump loyalists in the campaign, saying \u201cTrump often just repeats whatever he\u2019s heard from the last person who spoke to him,\u201d and expressing the view that this was especially dangerous when Trump was away.\n\nOver the course of a few phone calls, initially with Smith and later with Smith and one of his associates\u2014a man named John Szobocsan\u2014I was asked about my observations on technical details buried in the State Department\u2019s release of Secretary Clinton\u2019s emails (such as noting a hack attempt in 2011, or how Clinton\u2019s emails might have been intercepted by Russia due to lack of encryption). I was also asked about aspects of the DNC hack, such as why I thought the \u201cGuccifer 2\u201d persona really was in all likelihood operated by the Russian government, and how it wasn\u2019t necessary to rely on CrowdStrike\u2019s attribution as blind faith; noting that I had come to the same conclusion independently based on entirely public evidence, having been initially doubtful of CrowdStrike\u2019s conclusions.\n\nTowards the end of one of our conversations, Smith made his pitch. He said that his team had been contacted by someone on the \u201cdark web\u201d; that this person had the emails from Hillary Clinton\u2019s private email server (which she had subsequently deleted), and that Smith wanted to establish if the emails were genuine. If so, he wanted to ensure that they became public prior to the election. What he wanted from me was to determine if the emails were genuine or not.\n\nIt is no overstatement to say that my conversations with Smith shocked me. Given the amount of media attention given at the time to the likely involvement of the Russian government in the DNC hack, it seemed mind-boggling for the Trump campaign\u2014or for this offshoot of it\u2014to be actively seeking those emails. To me this felt really wrong.\n\nIn my conversations with Smith and his colleague, I tried to stress this point: if this dark web contact is a front for the Russian government, you really don\u2019t want to play this game. But they were not discouraged. They appeared to be convinced of the need to obtain Clinton\u2019s private emails and make them public, and they had a reckless lack of interest in whether the emails came from a Russian cut-out. Indeed, they made it quite clear to me that it made no difference to them who hacked the emails or why they did so, only that the emails be found and made public before the election.\n\nIn the end, I never saw the actual materials they\u2019d been given, and to this day, I don\u2019t know whether there were genuine emails, or whether Smith and his associates were deluding themselves.\n\nBy the middle of September, all contact between us ended. By this time, I had grown extremely uncomfortable with the situation, so when Smith and his colleague asked me to sign a non-disclosure agreement, I declined to do so. My suspicion was that the real purpose of the non-disclosure agreement was to retrospectively apply confidentiality to the conversations we had already had before that point. I refused to sign the non-disclosure and we went our separate ways.\n\nAs I mentioned above, Smith and his associates\u2019 knowledge of the inner workings of the campaign were insightful beyond what could be obtained by merely attending Republican events or watching large amounts of news coverage. But one thing I could not place, at least initially, was whether Smith was working on behalf of the campaign, or whether he was acting independently to help the campaign in his personal capacity.\n\nThen, a few weeks into my interactions with Smith, he sent me a document, ostensibly a cover page for a dossier of opposition research to be compiled by Smith\u2019s group, and which purported to clear up who was involved. The document was entitled \u201cA Demonstrative Pedagogical Summary to be Developed and Released Prior to November 8, 2016,\u201d and dated September 7. It detailed a company Smith and his colleagues had set up as a vehicle to conduct the research: \u201cKLS Research\u201d, set up as a Delaware LLC \u201cto avoid campaign reporting,\u201d and listing four groups who were involved in one way or another.\n\nThe first group, entitled \u201cTrump Campaign (in coordination to the extent permitted as an independent expenditure)\u201d listed a number of senior campaign officials: Steve Bannon, Kellyanne Conway, Sam Clovis, Lt. Gen. Flynn and Lisa Nelson.\n\nThe largest group named a number of \u201cindependent groups / organizations / individuals / resources to be deployed.\u201d My name appears on this list. At the time, I didn\u2019t recognize most of the others; however, several made headlines in the weeks immediately prior to the election.\n\nMy perception then was that the inclusion of Trump campaign officials on this document was not merely a name-dropping exercise. This document was about establishing a company to conduct opposition research on behalf of the campaign, but operating at a distance so as to avoid campaign reporting. Indeed, the document says as much in black and white.\n\nThe combination of Smith\u2019s deep knowledge of the inner workings of the campaign, this document naming him in the \u201cTrump campaign\u201d group, and the multiple references to needing to avoid campaign reporting suggested to me that the group was formed with the blessing of the Trump campaign. In the Journal\u2019s story this evening, several of the individuals named in the document denied any connection to Smith, and it\u2019s certainly possible that he was a big name-dropper and never really represented anyone other than himself. If that\u2019s the case, Smith talked a very good game.\n\nI\u2019m sure readers are wondering: why did I keep quiet at the time? Actually, I didn\u2019t. In the fall, prior to the election, I discussed the events of the story first with a friend, and secondly with a journalist. The trouble was that neither I nor the reporter in question knew what to make of the whole operation. It was certainly clear that the events were bizarre, and deeply unsettling. But it wasn\u2019t reportable.\n\nAfter all, Clinton\u2019s private emails never materialized. We couldn\u2019t show that Smith had been in contact with actual Russians. And while I believed\u2014as I still do\u2014that he was operating with some degree of coordination with the campaign, that was at least a little murky too. The story just didn\u2019t make much sense\u2014that is, until the Journal yesterday published the critical fact that U.S. intelligence has reported that Russian hackers were looking to get emails to Flynn through a cut-out during the Summer of 2016, and this was no idle speculation on my part.\n\nSuddenly, my story seemed important\u2014and ominous.", "authors": ["Matt Tait"], "publication_date": "2017-06-30'T'22:50:17"}
