Comey and Director of National Intelligence James R. Clapper Jr. are in agreement with a CIA assessment that Russia intervened in the 2016 election in part to help Donald Trump win the White House, officials disclosed Friday, as President Obama issued a public warning to Moscow that it could face retaliation.\n\nNew revelations about Comey\u2019s position could put to rest suggestions by some lawmakers that the CIA and the FBI weren\u2019t on the same page on Russian President Vladi\u00admir Putin\u2019s intentions.\n\nRussia has denied being behind the cyber-intrusions, which targeted the Democratic National Committee and the private emails of Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign chairman, John Podesta. Trump, in turn, has repeatedly said he doubts the veracity of U.S. intelligence blaming Moscow for the hacks.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s ridiculous,\u201d Trump said in an interview with \u201cFox News Sunday,\u201d his first Sunday news-show appearance since the Nov. 8 election. \u201cI think it\u2019s just another excuse. I don\u2019t believe it. . . . No, I don\u2019t believe it at all.\u201d\n\nAt a \u201cthank you\u201d event Thursday night with some of her top campaign donors and fundraisers, Clinton said she believed Russian-backed hackers went after her campaign because of a personal grudge that Putin had against her. Putin had blamed Clinton for fomenting mass protests in Russia after disputed 2011 parliamentary elections that challenged his rule. Putin said Clinton, then secretary of state, had \u201csent a signal\u201d to protesters by labeling the elections \u201cneither free nor fair.\u201d\n\n(Jason Aldag/The Washington Post)\n\n[Moscow has the world\u2019s attention. For Putin, that\u2019s a win.]\n\nThe positions of Comey and Clapper were revealed in a message that CIA Director John Brennan sent to the agency\u2019s workforce Friday.\n\n\u201cEarlier this week, I met separately with FBI [Director] James Comey and DNI Jim Clapper, and there is strong consensus among us on the scope, nature, and intent of Russian interference in our presidential election,\u201d Brennan said, according to U.S. officials who have seen the message.\n\nThe CIA and the FBI declined to comment on Brennan\u2019s message or on the classified intelligence assessment that CIA officials shared with members of the Senate Intelligence Committee earlier this month, setting off a political firestorm.\n\nIn the closed-door Senate briefing, CIA officials said it was now \u201cquite clear\u201d that electing Trump was one of Russia\u2019s goals, according to the officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss intelligence matters.\n\nCIA and FBI officials do not think Russia had a \u201csingle purpose\u201d by intervening during the presidential campaign, officials said. In addition to the goal of helping elect Trump, Putin aimed to undermine confidence in the U.S. electoral system, intelligence officials have told lawmakers.\n\nA few days after the Senate briefing, a senior FBI counter\u00adintelligence official briefed the House Intelligence Committee but was not as categorical as the CIA briefer about Russia\u2019s intention to help Trump, according to officials who were present. The FBI official\u2019s more cautious presentation of the intelligence to the House panel left some Republican and Democratic lawmakers in the room with the impression that the FBI disagreed with the CIA.\n\n(Reuters)\n\nOfficials close to the FBI and the CIA now say that lawmakers had misunderstood Comey\u2019s position. \u201cThe truth is they were never all that different in the first place,\u201d an official said. Similarly, officials said, Clapper and Brennan saw the intelligence the same way.\n\nEarlier this week, Rep. Devin Nunes (R-Calif.), chairman of the House Intelligence Committee and a Trump supporter, wrote to spy chiefs to demand briefings on the Russian meddling.\n\nBut Clapper responded that he wanted to first complete a review of all available U.S. intelligence, as directed by Obama.\n\nBrennan tried to talk to Nunes several times about the dispute. But officials said the congressman didn\u2019t take his calls until after he issued a statement Wednesday asking intelligence leaders to \u201cclarify press reports that the CIA has a new assessment that it has not shared with us.\u201d\n\nOfficials disputed the statement, saying Nunes had been fully briefed on the intelligence.\n\n\u201cIn recent days, I have had several conversations with members of Congress, providing an update on the status of the review as well as the considerations that need to be taken into account as we proceed,\u201d Brennan wrote in his message to CIA staffers. \u201cMany \u2014 but unfortunately not all \u2014 members understand and appreciate the importance and the gravity of the issue, and they are very supportive of the process that is underway.\u201d\n\nBrennan wrote to the CIA workforce, officials said, to reassure them in the face of accusations from Trump supporters that intelligence was being politicized.\n\nIn a statement, Nunes said: \u201cWe have not received any information from Intelligence Community (IC) agencies indicating that they have developed new assessments on this issue. I am alarmed that supposedly new information continues to leak to the media but has not been provided to Congress.\u201d\n\nIn one of the last news conferences of his presidency, Obama defended his administration\u2019s response to the Russian hacking and vowed to \u201csend a clear message to Russia\u201d that its meddling was unacceptable.\n\n\u201cI think we handled it the way it should have been handled,\u201d he said of the hacking investigation and the lack of a formal accusation of blame until a month before the election. \u201cWe allowed law enforcement and the intelligence community to do its job without political influence.\u201d\n\nObama was referring to an Oct. 7 statement by Clapper and Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson publicly blaming Russia for hacking political organizations, a clear reference to the Democratic National Committee and other Democratic officials.\n\nU.S. officials said an earlier draft of the Clapper-Johnson statement singled out Putin by name for authorizing the influence operation. But before the final statement was made public, Putin\u2019s name was removed \u201cso it wouldn\u2019t be provocative,\u201d one official said. Instead, the statement blamed \u201cRussia\u2019s senior-most officials.\u201d\n\nAt that time, Obama said, the U.S. intelligence community \u201cdid not attribute motives\u201d to Russia\u2019s decision to intervene in the election.\n\n\u201cImagine if we had done the opposite,\u201d he said Friday. \u201cIt would have become immediately just one more political scrum. And part of the goal here was to make sure that we did not do the work of the leakers for them by raising more and more questions about the integrity of the election right before the election was taking place \u2014 at a time, by the way, when the president-elect himself was raising questions about the integrity of the election.\u201d\n\nAt Friday\u2019s news conference, Obama did not directly point the finger at the Russian president. But he came close to doing so by saying: \u201cNot much happens in Russia without Vladimir Putin.\u201d\n\n[Putin wants revenge and respect, and hacking the U.S. is his way of getting it]\n\nSome members of Clinton\u2019s campaign, Democrats in Congress and others have taken the Obama administration to task for not calling out Russian efforts to influence the election sooner, as well as for not taking retaliatory action against those responsible for the cyber-intrusions and leaks to WikiLeaks, the anti-\n\nsecrecy group.\n\nObama said some possible retaliatory measures might not be seen by the public, although they would be seen or felt by Moscow. Obama, who has only a few weeks left in office, made clear any response to the hacks must be carefully thought through.\n\n\u201cThe relationship between us and Russia has deteriorated, sadly, significantly over the last several years,\u201d Obama said. \u201cAnd so how we approach an appropriate response that increases costs for them for behavior like this in the future but does not create problems for us is something that\u2019s worth taking the time to think through and figure out.\u201d\n\nAbby Phillip and Greg Miller contributed to this report.", "authors": [], "publication_date": "2016-12-16'T'00:00:00"}
