Though the full agenda remains unclear, the UAE agreed to broker the meeting in part to explore whether Russia could be persuaded to curtail its relationship with Iran, including in Syria, a Trump administration objective that would be likely to require major concessions to Moscow on U.S. sanctions.\n\nThough Prince had no formal role with the Trump campaign or transition team, he presented himself as an unofficial envoy for Trump to high-ranking Emiratis involved in setting up his meeting with the Putin confidant, according to the officials, who did not identify the Russian.\n\nPrince was an avid supporter of Trump. After the Republican convention, he contributed $250,000 to Trump\u2019s campaign, the national party and a pro-Trump super PAC led by GOP mega-donor Rebekah Mercer, records show. He has ties to people in Trump\u2019s circle, including Stephen K. Bannon, now serving as the president\u2019s chief strategist and senior counselor. Prince\u2019s sister Betsy DeVos serves as education secretary in the Trump administration. And Prince was seen in the Trump transition offices in New York in December.\n\nU.S. officials said the FBI has been scrutinizing the Seychelles meeting as part of a broader probe of Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. election and alleged contacts between associates of Putin and Trump. The FBI declined to comment.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Seychelles encounter, which one official said spanned two days, adds to an expanding web of connections between Russia and Americans with ties to Trump \u2014 contacts that the White House has been reluctant to acknowledge or explain until they have been exposed by news organizations.\n\n\u201cWe are not aware of any meetings, and Erik Prince had no role in the transition,\u201d said Sean Spicer, the White House press secretary.\n\nA Prince spokesman said in a statement: \u201cErik had no role on the transition team. This is a complete fabrication. The meeting had nothing to do with President Trump. Why is the so-called under-resourced intelligence community messing around with surveillance of American citizens when they should be hunting terrorists?\u201d\n\nPrince is best known as the founder of Blackwater, a security firm that became a symbol of U.S. abuses in Iraq after a series of incidents, including one in 2007 in which the company\u2019s guards were accused \u2014 and later criminally convicted \u2014 of killing civilians in a crowded Iraqi square. Prince sold the firm, which was subsequently re-branded, but has continued building a private paramilitary empire with contracts across the Middle East and Asia. He now heads a Hong Kong-based company known as the Frontier Services Group.\n\nPrince would probably have been seen as too controversial to serve in any official capacity in the Trump transition or administration. But his ties to Trump advisers, experience with clandestine work and relationship with the royal leaders of the Emirates \u2014 where he moved in 2010 amid mounting legal problems for his American business \u2014 would have positioned him as an ideal go-between.\n\nThe Seychelles meeting came after separate private discussions in New York involving high-ranking representatives of Trump with both Moscow and the Emirates.\n\nThe White House has acknowledged that Michael T. Flynn, Trump\u2019s original national security adviser, and Trump adviser and son-in-law Jared Kushner met with the Russian ambassador to the United States, Sergey Kislyak, in late November or early December in New York.\n\nFlynn and Kushner were joined by Bannon for a separate meeting with the crown prince of Abu Dhabi, Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed al-Nahyan, who made an undisclosed visit to New York later in December, according to the U.S., European and Arab officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive matters.\n\nIn an unusual breach of protocol, the UAE did not notify the Obama administration in advance of the visit, though officials found out because Zayed\u2019s name appeared on a flight manifest.\n\nOfficials said Zayed and his brother, the UAE\u2019s national security adviser, coordinated the Seychelles meeting with Russian government officials with the goal of establishing an unofficial back channel between Trump and Putin.\n\nOfficials said Zayed wanted to be helpful to both leaders, who had talked about working more closely together, a policy objective long advocated by the crown prince. The UAE, which sees Iran as one of its main enemies, also shared the Trump team\u2019s interest in finding ways to drive a wedge between Moscow and Tehran.\n\nZayed met twice with Putin in 2016, according to Western officials, and urged the Russian leader to work more closely with the Emirates and Saudi Arabia \u2014 an effort to isolate Iran.\n\nAt the time of the Seychelles meeting and for weeks afterward, the UAE believed that Prince had the blessing of the new administration to act as its unofficial representative. The Russian participant was a person whom Zayed knew was close to Putin from his interactions with both men, the officials said.\n\nScrutiny over Russia\n\nWhen the Seychelles meeting took place, official contacts between members of the incoming Trump administration and the Russian government were under intense scrutiny, both from federal investigators and the press.\n\nLess than a week before the Seychelles meeting, U.S. intelligence agencies released a report accusing Russia of intervening clandestinely during the 2016 election to help Trump win the White House.\n\nThe FBI was already investigating communications between Flynn and Kislyak. The Washington Post\u2019s David Ignatius first disclosed those communications on Jan. 12, around the time of the Seychelles meeting. Flynn was subsequently fired by Trump for misleading Vice President Pence and others about his discussions with Kislyak.\n\nYousef Al Otaiba, the UAE\u2019s ambassador in Washington, declined to comment.\n\nGovernment officials in the Seychelles said they were not aware of any meetings between Trump and Putin associates in the country around Jan. 11. But they said luxury resorts on the island are ideal for clandestine gatherings like the one described by the U.S., European and Arab officials.\n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t be surprised at all,\u201d said Barry Faure, the Seychelles secretary of state for foreign affairs. \u201cThe Seychelles is the kind of place where you can have a good time away from the eyes of the media. That\u2019s even printed in our tourism marketing. But I guess this time you smelled something.\u201d\n\nTrump has dismissed the investigations of Russia\u2019s role in the election as \u201cfake news\u201d and a \u201cwitch hunt.\u201d\n\nThe level of discretion surrounding the Seychelles meeting seems extraordinary given the frequency with which senior Trump advisers, including Flynn and Kushner, had interacted with Russian officials in the United States, including at the high-profile Trump Tower in New York.\n\nSteven Simon, a National Security Council senior director for the Middle East and North Africa in the Obama White House, said: \u201cThe idea of using business cutouts, or individuals perceived to be close to political leaders, as a tool of diplomacy is as old as the hills. These unofficial channels are desirable precisely because they are deniable; ideas can be tested without the risk of failure.\u201d\n\nCurrent and former U.S. officials said that while Prince refrained from playing a direct role in the Trump transition, his name surfaced so frequently in internal discussions that he seemed to function as an outside adviser whose opinions were valued on a range of issues, including plans for overhauling the U.S. intelligence community.\n\nHe appears to have particularly close ties to Bannon, appearing multiple times on the Breitbart satellite radio program and website that Bannon ran before joining the Trump campaign.\n\nIn a July interview with Bannon, Prince said those seeking forceful U.S. leadership should \u201cwait till January and hope Mr. Trump is elected.\u201d And he lashed out at President Barack Obama, saying that because of his policies \u201cthe terrorists, the fascists, are winning.\u201d\n\nDays before the November election, Prince appeared on the Breitbart radio program, saying that he had \u201cwell-placed sources\u201d in the New York City Police Department telling him they were preparing to make arrests in the investigation of former congressman Anthony Weiner (D-N.Y.) over allegations he exchanged sexually explicit texts with a minor. Flynn tweeted a link to the Breitbart report on the claim. No arrests occurred.\n\nPrince went on to make unfounded assertions that damaging material recovered from Weiner\u2019s computers would implicate Hillary Clinton and her close adviser, Huma Abedin, who was married to Weiner. He also called Abedin an \u201cagent of influence very sympathetic to the Muslim Brotherhood.\u201d\n\nPrince and his family were major GOP donors in 2016. The Center for Responsive Politics reported that the family gave more than $10 million to GOP candidates and super PACs, including about $2.7 million from his sister, DeVos, and her husband.\n\nPrince\u2019s father, Edgar Prince, built his fortune through an auto-parts company. Betsy married Richard DeVos Jr., heir to the Amway fortune.\n\nErik Prince has had lucrative contracts with the UAE government, which at one point paid his firm a reported $529 million to help bring in foreign fighters to help assemble an internal paramilitary force capable of carrying out secret operations and protecting Emirati installations from terrorist attacks.\n\nFocus on Iran\n\nThe Trump administration and the UAE appear to share a similar preoccupation with Iran. Current and former officials said that Trump advisers were focused throughout the transition period on exploring ways to get Moscow to break ranks with Tehran.\n\n\u201cSeparating Russia from Iran was a common theme,\u201d said a former intelligence official in the Obama administration who met with Trump transition officials. \u201cIt didn\u2019t seem very well thought out. It seemed a little premature. They clearly had a very specific policy position, which I found odd given that they hadn\u2019t even taken the reins and explored with experts in the U.S. government the pros and cons of that approach.\u201d\n\nMichael McFaul, former U.S. ambassador to Russia, said he also had discussions with people close to the Trump administration about the prospects of drawing Russia away from Iran. \u201cWhen I would hear this, I would think, \u2018Yeah that\u2019s great for you guys, but why would Putin ever do that?\u2019 \u201d McFaul said. \u201cThere is no interest in Russia ever doing that. They have a long relationship with Iran. They\u2019re allied with Iran in fighting in Syria. They sell weapons to Iran. Iran is an important strategic partner for Russia in the Middle East.\u201d\n\nFollowing the New York meeting between the Emiratis and Trump aides, Zayed was approached by Prince, who said he was authorized to act as an unofficial surrogate for the president-elect, according to the officials. He wanted Zayed to set up a meeting with a Putin associate. Zayed agreed and proposed the Seychelles as the meeting place because of the privacy it would afford both sides. \u201cHe wanted to be helpful,\u201d one official said of Zayed.\n\nWealthy Russians and Emirati royalty have a particularly large footprint on the islands. Signs advertising deep-sea fishing trips are posted in Cyrillic. Russian billionaire Mikhail Prokhorov owns North Island, where Prince William and Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge, went on their honeymoon in 2011. Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed al-Nahyan, president of the UAE, built a hilltop palace for himself with views across the chain of islands.\n\nThe Emiratis have given hundreds of millions of dollars to the Seychelles in recent years for causes including public health and affordable housing. But when the Emirati royal family visits, they are rarely seen.\n\n\u201cThe jeep comes to their private jet on the tarmac and they disappear,\u201d said one Seychellois official who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he did not want to be seen as criticizing the Emiratis.\n\nZayed, the crown prince, owns a share of the Seychelles\u2019 Four Seasons, a collection of private villas scattered on a lush hillside on the main island\u2019s southern shore, overlooking the Indian Ocean, according to officials in the Seychelles. The hotel is tucked away on a private beach, far from the nearest public road.\n\nCurrent and former U.S. officials who have worked closely with Zayed, who is often referred to as MBZ, say it would be out of character for him to arrange the Jan. 11 meeting without getting a green light in advance from top aides to Trump and Putin, if not the leaders themselves. \u201cMBZ is very cautious,\u201d said an American businessman who knows Zayed and spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the subject. \u201cThere had to be a nod.\u201d\n\nThe Seychelles meeting was deemed productive by the UAE and Russia, but the idea of arranging additional meetings between Prince and Putin\u2019s associates was dropped, officials said. Even unofficial contacts between Trump and Putin associates had become too politically risky, officials said.\n\nSieff reported from the Seychelles.
